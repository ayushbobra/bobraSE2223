                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">The goal of this study was to determine how soil acidity affects the egg hatch rate of <em>Eisenia hortensis</em>, a type of earthworm. Earthworms contribute to the soil ecosystem and allow for other organisms in the soil to thrive, so if their development is hindered, the entire soil ecosystem could suffer. The hypothesis of the study was that the more acidic the soil was, the lower the hatch rate of <em>Eisenia hortensis</em> eggs would be. The experiment tested to see how the pH of the soil that the eggs were in affected the hatch rate of those eggs. Three plastic bins were each filled with different amounts of peat moss and worm bedding until they each had a soil pH of 5, 6, and 7. 20 <em>Eisenia hortensis</em> eggs were then placed into each bin. Every day, the soil acidity was measured in each bin, and the number of worms in each bin was recorded. The resulting data was then analyzed with an ANOVA test and 3 t-tests. The statistical analysis showed that the bin with the soil pH of 6 produced significantly more worms than the other two bins and thus had the highest hatch rate. This data suggests that <em>Eisenia hortensis</em> and its eggs are able to grow and develop best in soil with a pH of 6. This opens the door for future studies on how soil acidity may affect the physical and behavioral characteristics of adult earthworms or studies on how other soil conditions (such as concentrations of different minerals/elements) could affect earthworms.

                    <h1 class="secHeader" id="ovPadRight">Rationale</h1>
                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">With the emergence and ongoing use of these fertilizers/pesticides, it is essential to understand how the increase in soil acidity affects the earthworms in the soil. Worms typically survive in a pH range of around 5-8, but they prefer neutral pH. This trend is consistent throughout many species of worms, but it varies based on the species, because some will not prefer exactly neutral pH. For instance, one study focusing on the worm <em>Aporrectodea longa</em> found that the worms prefer a pH of 6.7. Earthworms are also very sensitive to substances in their environment, and they will often absorb these substances. A study found that high concentrations of lead in the environment caused certain species of worms to absorb the lead into their own bodies. However, research has not been done regarding how the growth of earthworms and the development of their eggs is affected in different pH levels. If earthworms are taking longer amounts of time to grow, or their growth and development is being hindered in some way, they will not be able to readily contribute to the soil ecosystem. As a result, plants or other organisms in the soil that rely on earthworms for survival could see their growth and overall health be negatively impacted. Therefore, to better understand how soil acidity affects the growth and development of earthworms, the development of <em>Eisenia hortensis</em> eggs was tested under different soil pH levels to fully understand the effects of more acidic soil.</p>

                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">Research Practicum is a class that is required for all sophomores at High Technology High School. It takes place during the first three marking periods of the school year and builds upon the research idea created in Introduction to Research during freshman year. Research Practicum aims to teach students how to conduct their own independent research project and provides students with a mentor to assist them as necessary. During Research Practicum, students conduct their own independent research project and write progress reports every week. The course culminates with a final, comprehensive research paper and an oral defense of the project. Research Practicum is a very important class because it teaches students how to conduct a proper research project using the scientific method. It also gives students experience conducting an independent project outside of school and teaches effective time management skills. Finally, it prepares students for participation in research competitions.</p>
